# MAIN GUIDELINES
# * All metrics related to system resources are put under `system` as a root, this implies a merging of System with CPU, Disk, Network, Memory, etc.
# * There wasn't (much) of a concern to keep the hierarhy/section levels to a minimum, logic was priortized against outcome
# * Netdata Overview screen with in-section filter capabilites, as well as, better and easier Custom Dashboard creation/management features are considered to allow better UX
# * POC was focused on doing some sections to proof the logic, System, Virtualization, ...
# * OpenTelemety Metric Semantic Convetions were followed to the best of our understanding (even they seem to have different approaches in different domains) - https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/semantic_conventions/README.md
#   - same metric attributes were purposefuly set as part of the context name to better present things to the user, e.g. system.cpu.core.utilization where `core` should be an attribute
#
# * Future ideas discussed outside of the scope of this work:
#  - collectors should provide the following context of a metric (likely more, the gist is to provide a context):
#    - applicable/default aggregation methods (e.g. no sense in SUM temperature|network interface duplex|any metric that represents encodes a state (0: running, 1: pending, 2: failed, etc.))
#    - applicable/default grouping methods
#    - key/main metrics, which should be shown per default and an element with (...) would allow user to expand --> user perference could override this
